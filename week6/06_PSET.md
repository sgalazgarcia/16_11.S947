# Front End Environments
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

All the files you will want to use today are provided in the Week 6
folder of the class repo. The files for the website are in 'website'.

Data is in the 'data' folder, and found on the shared data dropbox.

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Customize your website on Github by using Leaflet and JavaScript to add a Leaflet map of Riyadh.

Using data from Riyadh in the shared Dropbox, this Leaflet map should contain:

* 2 GeoJSON layers (ie TAZ and Roads)
* 1 CSV layer
* make one of the layers interactive (ie with a popup)
* 1 basemap tile layer (such as openstreetmap)

On your website, get rid of the cat image, replace it with one of your own :)

### Deliverable

Place this map on your [username].github.io website and submit the URL to Stellar.

<strong>Bonus</strong> customize your website by adding some style.

1. Change the font
2. Adjust the layout and size of the map and various elements
3. Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) in your page customization
